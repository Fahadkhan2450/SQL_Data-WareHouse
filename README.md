# ETL_Data-WareHouse
A modern data ware house with SQl server following ETL processes , data modeling,and analytics

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The architecture of this project is based on the **Medallion Architecture**, structured into three layers: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.

- **Bronze Layer** — Holds raw, unprocessed data exactly as it comes from the source systems. Data is loaded from CSV files directly into a SQL Server database.
- **Silver Layer** — Applies data cleansing, standardization, and normalization so the data is ready for downstream analysis.
- **Gold Layer** — Contains business-ready data, structured into a star schema to support reporting and analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project covers the following areas:

- **Data Architecture** — Designing a modern data warehouse built on the Bronze, Silver, and Gold layer model.
- **ETL Pipelines** — Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse 

**Objective**
Build a modern data warehouse using SQL Server that consolidates sales data from multiple sources, enabling reliable analytical reporting and better decision-making.

**Specifications**
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems — ERP and CRM — supplied as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Identify and resolve data quality issues before the data is analyzed.
- **Integration**: Merge both sources into a single, easy-to-use data model built for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Work with the most current dataset only; historical tracking of data changes is not required.
- **Documentation**: Deliver clear, well-organized documentation of the data model for both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

**Objective**
Build SQL-based analytics that provide clear insight into:

- Customer Behavior
- Product Performance
- Sales Trends

These insights give stakeholders the key metrics they need to make informed, strategic decisions.
